Vim Configuration
George Lesica <george@lesica.com>

This is my Vim configuration. It uses Vundle to manage plugins and includes a
handy script to set up all the necessary symlinks without clobbering the
existing configuration files.

Some notes on setup and using Vundle:

Vundle is included as a submodule to make installation simpler. To clone:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To add an additional plugin repo just add an entry in the vimrc file.

    Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive' " Adds fugitive plugin

To install plugins:

    :PluginInstall

Or, from the shell, to install plugins and quit:

    vim +PluginInstall +qall
